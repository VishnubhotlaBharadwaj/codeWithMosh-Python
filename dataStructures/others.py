# Stack --> Last In First Out (LIFO)
# .append() to add items in the last
# .pop() to remove items from the last

# Queue --> First IN First Out (FIFO)
# If there are many objects in the queue, removing the first element make the other elements to shift one position left which leads to performance issues
# To tackle the above problem --> we use Dequeue method
# to remove first element --> .popleft() is used

# Tuples --> read only list, we cannot modify existing objects
# () is used to define a tuple
